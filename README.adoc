== The Asciidoctor Browser Extension

When you see raw https://asciidoctor.org[asciidoctor] source in your browser, then either you are viewing a local file or the server did not render it:

image:adocraw.png[asciidoc raw, 400]

What you probably want to see instead is something like this:


image:rendered.png[asciidoc rendered,400]


This comes to rescue: +
https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-browser-extension[asciidoctor/asciidoctor-browser-extension: An extension for web browsers that converts AsciiDoc files to HTML using Asciidoctor.js.]

As described there, the extension is available for chrome, ff and opera.

IMPORTANT: Install the extension and your *browser* will take care of the rendering, using a javascript port of asciidoctor.

NOTE: In repository browsers, you have to view the page as raw in order to get it rendered. +
Means: Click the `raw view` button. +

== Custom Script

=== Added Value 

The extension allows to hook in custom javascript.

This repo provides such a script, which adds support for

- `:toc: left`, support - i.e. a fixed table of contents on the left side, useful for longer documents
- a variety of default themes
- custom code themes
- theme switchers and query string support for `?theme=<theme name>`



=== Installation

1. Download script into any local directory:

[source,bash]
----
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/axiros/adoctools/master/browser/ax-adoc-chrome.js
----

2. Configure the extension to use it:

[cols="1,1"]
.Extension config
|===
|image:cfg1.png[]
|image:cfg.png[]
|===

NOTE: We set `toc=left` always, this is optional.

Thats it. You get two theme selector boxes, one for code style and one for the asciidoctor skin.

You have quite a few variations regarding style - see link:server/asciidoctor/index.txt[here]. All taken from https://github.com/darshandsoni/asciidoctor-skins[darshandsoni/asciidoctor-skins], unmodified.

TIP: To cycle through themes, hit `Alt-s` or `Alt-c` to focus, then arrow up or down.

=== Configuration

None - the file works standalone. Adapt the link:browser/ax-adoc-chrome.js[source] to your liking.

=== Security

* The file is injected as page script by the extension, i.e. has the same restrictions as any javascript.
* The extension does not offer a messaging channel currently, i.e. there is no communication with the extension. Means we cannot modify the source *before* rendering - only the HTML after rendering, like any javascript.

NOTE: Nevertheless we hook in in _prerender_ phase, in order to see set attributes while we have the source.


=== Known Problems / TODOs

* Sandboxed mode: Some servers deliver the site in sandboxed mode. Then the custom JS can't work:


.console output
[source]
----
Blocked script execution in 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-browser-extension/master/README.adoc' because the document's frame is sandboxed and the 'allow-scripts' permission is not set.
----


* No TOC: When the original document does not set a toc attribute, we can't produce one (did not want to manually recurse over Hx tags in the DOM).

Workaround: Configure `toc=left` in the Extension, like suggested in the screenshot above.


* No offline mode. Requires access to server

Currently the script is not storing the themes locally explicitely, but pulls them from a configurable server (default: This github repo), which would not work offline.

Workaround: You can throw them on any static webserver within your premises or on your localhost. Configuration is in the source of this script:

[source,javascript]
----
var SERVER_URL = <your url>
----

CAUTION: Reload the script within the extension config after changes.
